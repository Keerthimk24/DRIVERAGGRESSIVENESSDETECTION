Driver Aggressiveness Detection is a driver behavior monitoring system designed to analyze driving patterns using parameters such as speed, acceleration, braking intensity, and speeding percentage. The system classifies driving behavior into categories like Safe, Moderate, and Aggressive to enhance road safety and operational monitoring.
The platform implements role-based access control:
Admin – Can view and monitor all drivers’ data.
Driver – Can access only their individual performance records.
